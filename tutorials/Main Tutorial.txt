Welcome to Slothy Marker! This is a quick, interactive tutorial.

The application has two main modes: "Simple Mode" and "Transcript Mode". ==This tutorial is in Simple Mode.== In this mode, highlights are listed in the order they appear in the document.

==The text you see highlighted in orange here is also listed in the panel on the right.== Try clicking on this one in the right-hand list to see the document view jump right here!

You can create your own highlights! Drag your mouse over "this text" and click the green "Add Highlight" button, or use the Ctrl+H shortcut.
If your selection touches an existing highlight, it will automatically be merged. ==Try highlighting this text== to see it join with the previous highlight.

Made a mistake? No problem. The Undo and Redo buttons have you covered. You can also double-click a highlight in the list to edit its text.

==Try removing this highlight by clicking it in the list and then hitting the 'Remove' button.==

To get started with your own work, ==you can open a document (.docx, .pdf, .txt, .md)== by dragging it onto the window or using the "Open Document" button.

==Pro Tip: Understanding Transcript Mode==

A "paper edit" is a plan for a video, made by highlighting the best parts of a transcript. Slothy Marker's "Transcript Mode" is designed specifically for this.

It automatically finds timestamps for your highlights and sorts them chronologically. This lets you export a special `.srt` file that video editors can use.

To see this in action, use the example files in the sidebar on the left. The logic is simple: ==what you highlight is what you get, and the app finds the nearest timestamp for you.== Don't worry about including formatting tags like `<b>` or speaker names; your editor might need them!

If you want to play around more, here's a story about a sloth learning to use a highlighter. Go wild!:

Sid the sloth had a very important task. He needed to study the legendary Nap Manual, Volume IV, a tome filled with ancient secrets of profound slumber. The most critical passages needed to be marked for future reference. For this, he had acquired a brand-new, fluorescent yellow highlighter.

Opening the highlighter was the first challenge. It was an epic struggle of sloth versus plastic cap, a battle waged in slow motion over the course of an afternoon. With a final, heroic heave, the cap popped off and sailed through the air, landing in a distant houseplant. Sid made a mental note to retrieve it next Tuesday.

Now, the main event. He located the first crucial tip: "Chapter 3: The Importance of Yawning Before a Nap." This was vital information. He positioned the highlighter at the start of the sentence, took a deep breath, and began to drag it across the page.

It was a journey. The world seemed to blur as he moved the felt tip, millimeter by agonizing millimeter. He was a pioneer, a trailblazer, an artist painting with light. He could feel the burn in his... well, in the one claw he was using.

Finally, he reached the end of the sentence. He lifted the highlighter, his heart pounding (at a respectable two beats per minute), and admired his work. There it was: a triumphant, glowing yellow stripe. It was beautiful. It was perfect. It was... slightly wobbly.

He had done it. He had highlighted. It was, without a doubt, the most productive he had been all week. Exhausted but victorious, Sid closed the manual, leaned back in his branch, and took a well-deserved nap to celebrate his monumental achievement.
