00:00:12:05 Professor Von Sloth
(long pause) ...yes. Welcome to the Slow Symposium.
(Sometimes the speaker labels are like the below instead:)

Professor, your philosophy is revolutionary. You argue that modern society is moving... too fast. (Try highlighting the words "too fast" to see the app find the correct timestamp. Have a play around!)

Professor Von Sloth
[deep sigh] The world doesn't just move too fast. It moves at all. That is the... fundamental problem. The optimal state is... pre-movement.

(Either way, whether the labels are in line or not, it's the same result.) So what is the first step for someone wanting to adopt this philosophy? Is it meditation? (inaudible)

00:02:15:20 Professor Von Sloth
==No, no. Far too active. The first step is to master the art of preparing to think about maybe doing something. This highlight has an earlier timestamp. Notice how it appears near the top of the highlights list, demonstrating the chronological sorting.==

00:05:45:10 Interviewer
Fascinating. So after mastering that... what's next?

00:06:10:00 Professor Von Sloth
Then... you begin The Great Task.
