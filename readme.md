## üöÄ Installation

You can either download a pre-built version of the application or run it directly from the source code.

### For Users (Recommended)

Pre-compiled versions for your operating system can be found on the **[Releases](https://github.com/user/repo/releases)** page of this repository. This is the easiest way to get started.

### For Developers (Running from Source)

If you want to run the application from its source code, you'll need Python 3.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emzakit/slothymarker.git
cd slothymarker
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate```

**3. Install the required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the application:**
```bash
python main.py
```
*(Note: You may need to replace `main.py` with the actual name of the main script if it differs).*

### üì¶ Building the Application

Convenience scripts are provided to bundle the application into a distributable executable (`.exe` for Windows, `.app` for macOS) using PyInstaller.

These scripts automatically include necessary assets by reading from `collect_files.txt` and `collect_folders.txt`. Make sure these files are populated with any new assets you add.

*You must build in the desired operating system or virtual machine.*

*   **On Windows:**
    Run the Windows build script to create a `.exe` file in the `dist` folder.
    ```bash
    python build_win.py
    ```

*   **On macOS:**
    Run the macOS build script to create a `.app` bundle in the `dist` folder.
    ```bash
    python build_mac.py
    ```
